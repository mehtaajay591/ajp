Perform the following:
• Use contactlenses.arff and load it into WEKA. Check that all attributes
are nominal (categorical).
• Change to the Associate Panel. Select “Apriori” as associator. After
pressing the start button, Apriori starts to build its model and writes
its output into the output field. The first part of the output (“Run
information”) describes the options that have been set and the data set
used. Make sure you understand all the data reported.
• The rules that have been generated are listed at the end of the output. By
default, only the 10 most valuable rules according to their confidence
level are shown. Each rule consists of some attribute values on a left
hand side of the arrow, the arrow sign and the right hand side list of
attribute values. Right of the arrow sign are the predicted attribute
values. Rules have certain support and confidence values. The number
before the arrow sign is the number of instances the rule applies to.
The number after the arrow sign is the number of instances predicted
correctly. The number in brackets after ‘conf:’ is the confidence of
the rule. Analyse the rules mined from the data set. What are their
confidence and support values? Examine the number of large itemsets
– make sure you understand how this data has been calculated (check
that the values you would get ‘manually’ are correct).

To perform the specified tasks using the contactlenses.arff dataset in WEKA, follow these steps:

1. Load the Dataset into WEKA
Open WEKA: Launch the WEKA GUI.

Load the Dataset:

Go to the Explorer.
Click on the "Open file" button.
Select and open the contactlenses.arff file.
Check Attributes:

In the Preprocess tab, verify that all attributes are nominal (categorical). This can be seen in the list of attributes and their types.
2. Use the Apriori Algorithm
Go to the Associate Panel:

Click on the "Associate" tab.
Select the Apriori Algorithm:

From the list of association rules algorithms, select "Apriori".
Configure Parameters:

You can adjust parameters such as the minimum support and confidence values. For example, you can set the "minimum support" to 0.1 (10%) and "minimum confidence" to 0.8 (80%) if needed.
Run the Algorithm:

Click the "Start" button to run the Apriori algorithm.
View the Output:

After the algorithm runs, the output will be displayed in the output field. This includes the run information and the generated association rules.
3. Analyze the Output
Understand Run Information:

Options Set: This section shows the parameters used for the Apriori algorithm (e.g., minimum support and confidence).
Dataset Used: Information about the dataset, such as the number of instances and attributes.
Analyze the Rules:

The rules are listed at the end of the output. Each rule shows:
Left-hand Side (LHS): Attributes that precede the arrow.
Right-hand Side (RHS): Attributes that follow the arrow, which are the predicted values.
Support: The proportion of transactions that include the itemset.
Confidence: The proportion of transactions that include the itemset and also satisfy the rule.
Number of Instances: Number before the arrow indicates the number of instances the rule applies to; number after the arrow indicates the number of instances predicted correctly.
Conf: (Confidence): The confidence of the rule.
4. Examine Large Itemsets
Number of Large Itemsets:
The output will also include information about large itemsets found by Apriori. This information is essential to understand the patterns found by the algorithm.
Manual Calculation Check:
Support Calculation: This is the proportion of transactions that contain the itemset.
Confidence Calculation: This is the proportion of transactions that contain both the itemset and the consequent.
Example Analysis
Here’s a brief example of how to interpret the output:

Rule: {attribute1=val1, attribute2=val2} -> {attribute3=val3}
Number of Instances: 50/45

Support: 0.4 (40%)

Confidence: 0.9 (90%)

Interpretation:

The rule applies to 50 instances, out of which 45 are correctly predicted.
The support of 40% means that 40% of the transactions include both attribute1=val1 and attribute2=val2, as well as attribute3=val3.
The confidence of 90% means that 90% of the transactions with attribute1=val1 and attribute2=val2 also contain attribute3=val3.

13. Perform the following:
• Use zoo.arff dataset and load it into WEKA. Examine the attributes and
make sure you understand their meaning. Are all attributes nominal?

Data
Mining Lab
• In the preprocess area, deselect the animal and legs attributes. The
animal attribute is the name of the animal, and is not useful for mining.
The legs attribute is numeric and cannot be used directly with Apriori.
Alternatively, you can try to use the Discretize Filter to discretize the
legs attribute.
• After deselecting the attributes, use the Apply Filters button to generate
a working relation that removes those attributes. Notice how the working
relation changes, and has fewer attributes than the base relation.
• First, try using the Apriori algorithm with the default parameters.
Record the generated rules.
• Vary the number of rules generated (click on the command that you are
running). Try 20, 30, ... Record how many rules you have to generate
before generating a rule containing type=mammal.
• Vary the maximum support until a rule containing type=mammal
is the top rule generated. Record the maximum support needed. B7.
Select one generated rule that was interesting to you. Why was it
interesting? What does it mean? Check its confidence and support –
are they high enough? B8. Suggest one improvement to the Apriori
implementation in WEKA that would have made this data mining lab
easier to accomplish.


To perform the tasks using the zoo.arff dataset in WEKA, follow these steps:

1. Load the zoo.arff Dataset and Examine Attributes
Open WEKA:

Start the WEKA application by launching the GUI.
Load the Dataset:

Navigate to the Explorer: Click on the "Explorer" button on the main WEKA interface.
Open the File:
Go to the "Preprocess" tab.
Click the "Open file..." button.
Browse to the location of the zoo.arff file and select it. Click "Open".
Examine Attributes:

View Attributes:
In the "Preprocess" tab, you will see a list of attributes along with their types.
Examine each attribute and understand its meaning. For example:
Animal: The name of the animal (nominal).
Legs: Number of legs (numeric).
Type: Classification of the animal (nominal, e.g., mammal, bird, etc.).
Verify Attribute Types:
Check if all attributes are nominal. Note that some attributes might be numeric or string.
2. Deselect Attributes
Deselect Attributes:

In the "Preprocess" tab, select the "Remove" filter from the "Filter" options.
Choose the attributes "animal" and "legs" for removal:
Animal: This attribute is not useful for mining.
Legs: This numeric attribute can be problematic for the Apriori algorithm.
Apply Filters:

Click the "Apply" button to create a working relation that excludes the deselected attributes.
Observe that the working relation has fewer attributes compared to the original dataset.
3. Run the Apriori Algorithm
Apply Apriori Algorithm:

Switch to the "Associate" tab.
Select "Apriori" as the associator.
Use the default parameters and click "Start" to run the algorithm.
Record Generated Rules:
Note the rules generated by the algorithm, which will be displayed in the output field.
Generate More Rules:

To vary the number of rules generated, adjust the "numRules" parameter:
Run the algorithm with different values (e.g., 20, 30).
Record how many rules you need to generate before a rule containing type=mammal appears.
Adjust Maximum Support:

To find the maximum support needed to get type=mammal as the top rule:
Adjust the "maximum support" parameter.
Record the maximum support value needed for this.
4. Analyze and Interpret Rules
Select an Interesting Rule:
From the generated rules, choose one that you find interesting.
Analyze the Rule:
Check the confidence and support of the rule.
Interpret what the rule means in the context of the dataset.
Example: A rule might be {has_fur=true} -> {type=mammal}.
Interpretation: Animals with fur are classified as mammals.
Confidence: The proportion of instances with fur that are classified as mammals.
Support: The proportion of total instances that meet both conditions.
5. Suggest Improvements to WEKA’s Apriori Implementation
Improvement Suggestion:
Improvement: Implement an interactive visualization of frequent itemsets and rules to make it easier to understand and explore the results.
Reason: Visualization can help users quickly identify patterns and relationships, making the data mining process more intuitive and efficient.
Summary of Steps
Load and Examine: Load zoo.arff, check attributes.
Deselect: Remove animal and legs attributes.
Run Apriori: Use default parameters, then vary rules and support to find specific results.
Analyze Rules: Select, interpret, and evaluate an interesting rule.
Suggest Improvement: Recommend enhancements to WEKA’s Apriori functionality.
These steps will help you effectively use WEKA to analyze the zoo.arff dataset, generate association rules, and interpret the results.
