start tcp application and monito the packet flow. Make necessary assumption

Assumptions:
You have a TCP application (e.g., a simple server and client application).
You have administrative access to your machine.
You have a network monitoring tool installed (e.g., Wireshark).
You are familiar with basic networking concepts.
Steps to Start a TCP Application and Monitor Packet Flow
1. Create or Use an Existing TCP Application
For demonstration purposes, letâ€™s use a simple TCP client-server application written in Python.

TCP Server Code:

# tcp_server.py
import socket

def start_server():
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind(('0.0.0.0', 12345))  # Bind to all interfaces on port 12345
    server_socket.listen(1)
    print("Server listening on port 12345")
    
    conn, addr = server_socket.accept()
    print(f"Connected by {addr}")
    
    while True:
        data = conn.recv(1024)
        if not data:
            break
        print(f"Received data: {data.decode()}")
        conn.sendall(data)  # Echo the received data back to the client
    
    conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_server()

# tcp_client.py
import socket

def start_client():
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    client_socket.connect(('127.0.0.1', 12345))  # Connect to localhost on port 12345
    
    client_socket.sendall(b'Hello, server!')
    data = client_socket.recv(1024)
    print(f"Received from server: {data.decode()}")
    
    client_socket.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_client()

Run the TCP Application
Start the Server:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing tcp_server.py.
Run the server: python tcp_server.py.
Start the Client:

Open another terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing tcp_client.py.
Run the client: python tcp_client.py.
3. Monitor Packet Flow with Wireshark
Install Wireshark (if not already installed):

Download and install Wireshark from Wireshark's official website.
Start Wireshark:

Open Wireshark.
Select the network interface to monitor (e.g., eth0, wlan0, or en0).
Capture TCP Traffic:

In the filter bar, enter the filter tcp to capture only TCP packets.
Start capturing by clicking the "Start capturing packets" button.
Run Your TCP Application:

Ensure your TCP server and client applications are running as described.
Analyze Packet Flow:

Stop the capture in Wireshark after you have run the client application.
Review the captured packets:
Look for packets related to port 12345.
Analyze the SYN, ACK, and data packets to observe the connection setup and data transfer.
